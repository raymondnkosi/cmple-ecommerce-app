# Cmple Ecommerce Application
## This is the source code for the ecommerce applications I used to develop for my clients at Cmple Solutions.

- My company, Cmple Solutions, eventually specialized in developing ecommerce smartphone applications which integrate with an existing ecommerce system such as WooCommerce via the REST API to save costs and time by negating the need to build a new backend from scratch. 
- This also meant that data could be automatically synchronized between the existing ecommerce system and the application.
- The application is built using the Ionic Framework, Angular and Node Js.

    Here are some screenshots of the application in action:
